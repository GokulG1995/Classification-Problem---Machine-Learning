# Classification-Problem---Machine-Learning
Classification Problem in Machine Learning  A classification problem in machine learning is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the categorical label of a given input based on past observations with known labels. The target variable is discrete, and the model learns to assign each input to one of the predefined classes.

A classification problem in machine learning is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the categorical label of a given input based on past observations with known labels. The target variable is discrete, and the model learns to assign each input to one of the predefined classes.

Key Concepts in Classification:
Classes: The different categories or labels the model is trying to predict. For example, in a medical diagnosis, the classes might be "diseased" or "healthy."

Training Data: A labeled dataset where each instance has both the input features and the corresponding correct label.

Test Data: A separate dataset, usually kept unseen during training, used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

Model: The algorithm that learns from the training data and maps inputs to their predicted class labels. Common models for classification include:

Logistic Regression: A simple model for binary classification.
Decision Trees: A tree-like structure where decisions are made based on input features.
Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees used for more robust predictions.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds a hyperplane that best separates the classes.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Classifies based on the majority label of nearby points.
Neural Networks: Deep learning models that can handle complex patterns and large datasets.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision and Recall: Measures of classification performance, especially useful in imbalanced datasets.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.
Confusion Matrix: A table showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
